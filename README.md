# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling within route handlers.  The example shows a route that retrieves a user by ID from a database.  However, it lacks proper handling for cases where the user ID is invalid or the database operation fails.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the flawed Express.js route handler.  It's missing essential error checks: 

1. **No handling for database errors**: If the database query fails, the application crashes without any informative error message.
2. **No handling for non-existent users**: If a user with the specified ID is not found, the route doesn't send an appropriate HTTP response.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to fix the error handling. It incorporates proper checks for both database errors and non-existent users, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
